# Interval-Trainer
An [interactive website](https://srivastavaanubhav.github.io/Interval-Trainer/) where you can practice music intervals for upcoming exams (or just for fun).

## Notes
The table seen in debugging mode contains the probability of getting the next interval given your current interval. This changes over time to account for learning. A stronger model might be a recurrent neural net, which I am learning about now with the goal of implementing and integrating it later.
